# learning Reflections README

Overview
Throughout the build of these components , i had the opportunity to apply what  I have learned in HTML, Tailwind CSS and JavaScript, experimenting with different design and coding techniques from the different coaches as they also provided guidence to refine my work.

### Reflections

**Tailwind CSS**: Im slowly grasping using tailwind, Flexbox and Grid to structure The web page elements. Using these techniques to align, style and distribute content was the most interesting part.

### Areas of Mastery:

**CSS Layout Techniques**: I still need more practice with using the key layout techniques

**Responsive Design for Smaller Screens**:A mobile-first design approach is a strategy in web development, where the design and development process starts with designing for mobile devices first, and then progressively enhances the layout for larger screens, such as tablets & desktops.

### I got familiar with the basic file structure and learned how to use basic version control practices. 


**Code Optimization**: i need to improve and make sure my code readable to the next person and neat and making sense.

**Creative Design Choices**:i followed the components specified design layout. I feel that with more practice i can apply more changes.

Overall Learning Experience
This project was an eye opener and a great introduction the the vast world of web development.
